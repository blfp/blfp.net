Three of our practitioners recently attended the [Pain Care for Primary
Care][pcpc] conference in Orlando, Florida given by the [Journal of Family
Practice][jfp] and [American Pain Society][aps]. After attending classes during
the day, they were able to enjoy some of the sights at Epcot and Downtown
Disney in the evenings.
